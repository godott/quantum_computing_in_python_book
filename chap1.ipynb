    "\n",
    "We start with its most fundamental unit: the **qubit**. Unlike a classical bit, which is either a 0 or a 1, a qubit lives in a richer mathematical world. It doesn’t just *choose* between 0 and 1—it can *blend* them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blending happens in a complex vector space, and to describe it, physicists use **Dirac notation**, a sleek and powerful shorthand. A quantum state is written as a **ket**, like this: \\$|\\psi\\rangle\\$. Think of it as the quantum version of a column vector. The *dual* of a ket is a **bra**, written \\$\\langle \\psi|\\$, which you can think of as its row vector counterpart. Together, a *bra-ket* like \\$\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle\\$ gives you an inner product—an essential tool for calculating things like measurement probabilities.\n",

    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is more than just a pretty picture—it provides a powerful visual language. Single-qubit gates become rotations of the sphere, and quantum algorithms often reduce to navigating paths across its surface.\n",

    "\n",
