    "# Quantum Gates and Control: From Hermitian Matrices to Control Pulses\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Hermitian and Unitary matrices\n",
    "- Pauli matrices\n",
    "- Matrix exponentiation and rotations\n",
    "- Lie algebra ↔ Lie group connection\n",
    "- Quantum control using pulses\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve explored the basic building blocks of quantum computing: quantum gates like the Hadamard and CNOT, simple quantum circuits, and how measurement collapses quantum states. In this notebook, we’ll dive deeper into the mathematical structure that underlies these gates and learn how we can generate them from physical principles like Hamiltonians and control pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the Pauli matrices, which play a central role in quantum computing. These compact $2\\times 2$ matrices not only represent basic quantum gates (like the X, Y, and Z gates), but also serve as a complete basis for any operation on a single qubit. Think of them as the \"$XYZ$ axes\" for qubit dynamics on the Bloch sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll review two key classes of matrices: Hermitian matrices, which correspond to physical observables and quantum Hamiltonians, and unitary matrices, which describe all valid quantum evolutions. Understanding how these two types are connected through matrix exponentiation will give us insight into how quantum gates arise from physical interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we’ll introduce a beautiful idea from mathematics: the relationship between Lie algebras and Lie groups. This might sound fancy, but it's actually a very natural way to describe how quantum operations \"grow out of\" the generators like the Pauli matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll connect theory to practice by looking at quantum control. Specifically, we’ll learn how applying time-varying control pulses to a qubit allows us to implement gates like $X, Y, Z$ gates and arbitrary rotations. This is how real quantum computers—especially those built from superconducting qubits or trapped ions—actually work under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll see how math and physics come together to shape the circuits you've already been working with—and you'll gain a new appreciation for what it really means to rotate a qubit.\n",
